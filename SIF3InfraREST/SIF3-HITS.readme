The SIF3-HITS.zip is the SIF3InfraREST framework with a few customisations to cater for HITS. 

All changes to the framework code should be surrounded by a comment block of the form:

// HITS Customisation - Start
... your code changes, additions...
// HITS Customisation - End

The only exceptions where new stuff can be added without such a comment block are consumer and provider classes in the
Demo and/or Test source directories.
