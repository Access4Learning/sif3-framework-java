=======================================================
Release Notes for v0.3 of SIF3 Framework (12 Aug, 2014)
=======================================================

What is New
-----------
- Support for multiple Environment Templates in a DIRECT provider. See section 5.3.1.4 for details.
- Improved mime type management to honour the 'Accept' and 'Content-Type' HTTP header fields in a HTTP Request.
  If an invalid mime type is requested a nicer HTTP error status is returned.
- Initial support for some Simple SIF functionality on DIRECT Provider (i.e. some HTTP header fields are 
  defaulted if not provided)

Bug Fixes
-----------
- SolutionId in Environment Creation no longer mandatory for DIRECT provider. Now it matches the SIF 
  Specification.
- Fixed the way 'paging' information is passed to data object providers. Now they are passed as HTTP header 
  fields rather than as URL query parameters. Now it matches the SIF Specification.
- Correct name of 'paging' parameters is used. Now it matches the SIF Specification.
- Fixed exception handling when dealing with invalid mime types or invalid payloads.
- Added a couple new SIF Objects to the AU data model to meet the Time Table Use case.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------
The instructions below are applicable if you have version 0.2 of the framework installed and upgrade to this 
version 0.3. If you install the framework for the first time then please refer to the install instructions 
in the Developer's Guide (section 3.3 and section 5.3).

Instructions to upgrade from v0.2 to v0.3
-----------------------------------------
1) Copy the libraries in the "release" directory into your project.
2) Run the Data Fix to patch the tables for the SIF3 Framework: 
   /<instllDir>/DB/DDL/Datafix/current/v0.2-v0.3/Datafix20140626_<dbprod>.sql
   Note: Only scripts for MySQL, Oracle and SQLite are provided. If you use another DB product you may need 
         to modify the script to match the SQL syntax of your DB product.
3) This step is only required if you are running a DIRECT provider and you have created environment templates 
   (XML files in the <envBaseDir>/environments/provider/template/direct). In this case you must add them into 
   the appropriate database tables form now on.
   a) Take the name of the environment XML file and add it to the SIF3_ENV_TEMPLATE table. Note only the file
      name with the extension must be added, not the full path of the file. Give it a logical template ID name
      in the ENV_TEMPLATE_ID column.
   b) - Check your provider.properties file. Take the value of the following properties and add them to 
        appropriate columns in the SIF3_APP_TEMPLATE table: env.application.key, env.pwd, env.authentication.method.
      - Add the SolutionID to the applicable row in the SIF3_APP_TEMPLATE table and link it with the 
        ENV_TEMPLARE_ID from step 3a).
        
The above makes the SIF3 Framework aware that the application with the given APPLICATION_KEY, PASSWORD, 
SOLUTION_ID columns shall use the environment template with the ENV_TEMPLATE_ID. This allows the DIRECT 
environment to deal with any number of application each with a different environment template. It also allows 
multiple applications to share the same environment template but still have a credentials (APPLICATION_KEY, 
PASSWORD).
