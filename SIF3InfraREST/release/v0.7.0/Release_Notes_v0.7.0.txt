==============================================================
Release Notes for v0.7.0 of SIF3 Framework (July XX, 2015)
==============================================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- None

New Functionality
-----------------
- Support for compression (gzip) for all payloads on consumer and provider. For details please refer to section 5.12
  in the Developer's Guide. If compression is turned on within the SIF3 Framework for a provider then the library
  pjl-comp-filter-1.8.1.jar in the lib/pjl directory must be copied to the WEB-INF/lib directory of your project.
- Added external security service capabilities to consumers. See section 5.9.3 in the developer's guide.


Changed Functionality
---------------------
- Split sif3.0.1Infra-common-<version>.jar into 2 jars called:  
  - sif3.0.1Infra-common-<version>.jar
  - sif3.0.1Infra-model-<version>.jar
  The sif3.0.1Infra-model-<version>.jar holds the generated SIF Infrastructure data model. Please ensure that you have 
  both these jar files in your project code.  
- The latest version of the systemic-framework library has been added to the project. There are no changes in that
  library that affect the SIF3 Framework. It has been added to keep the SIF3 Framework up-to-date with the latest version
  of that library. Ensure to copy the new systemic-framework-20150618.jar to your project's library and remove the previous
  version (systemic-framework-20140410.jar).

Removed Artifacts/Functionality

--------------------------
-- Upgrade Instructions --
--------------------------

Infrastructure Upgrade
----------------------
- Drop the latest framework library into your project's lib directory/directories. Note that the new  
  sif3.0.1Infra-model-<version>.jar is now also required in your projetc's lib directories.
- Replace systemic-framework-20140410.jar with systemic-framework-20150618.jar in your projetc's lib directories.

===================================
NOTE: Potential Compilation Error!!
-----
If you use external security service functionality in your provider you will get a compilation error with the latest
SIF3 Framework libraries. To resolve that compilation error, you must implement the following method in your concrete
implementation of the security class that extends the AbstractSecurityService:

   TokenInfo generateToken(TokenCoreInfo coreInfo, String password)
   
This new method is enforced by the AbstractSecurityService class. The new method is only used by consumers and therefore
can be 'nulled' out in your security class:

   public TokenInfo generateToken(TokenCoreInfo coreInfo, String password) {
      return null;
   }
===================================


Data Model Upgrade
------------------
None.
