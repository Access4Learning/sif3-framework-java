==============================================================
Release Notes for v0.7.0 of SIF3 Framework (December 29, 2015)
==============================================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Changed accessToken URL Query Parameter to access_token as per RFC. This will also be reflected in the
  SIF 3.2 Infrastructure Specification.

New Functionality
-----------------
- Support for compression (gzip) for all payloads on consumer and provider. For details please refer to section 5.12
  in the Developer's Guide. If compression is turned on within the SIF3 Framework for a provider then the library
  pjl-comp-filter-1.8.1.jar in the lib/pjl directory must be copied to the WEB-INF/lib directory of your project.
- Added external security service capabilities to consumers. See section 5.9.3 in the developer's guide.
- DELAYED request/response is now fully supported for consumers. Please refer to "Upgrade Instructions" further
  down as this new functionality affects the implementation of all consumer classes.


Changed Functionality
---------------------
- Updated infrastructure model to 3.1. All framework jar files have now a 'sif3.1Infra' prefix.
- Split sif3.1Infra-common-<version>.jar into 2 jars called:  
  - sif3.1Infra-common-<version>.jar
  - sif3.1Infra-model-<version>.jar
  The sif3.1Infra-model-<version>.jar holds the generated SIF Infrastructure data model. Please ensure that you have 
  both these jar files in your project code.  
- The latest version of the systemic-framework library has been added to the project. There are no changes in that
  library that affect the SIF3 Framework. It has been added to keep the SIF3 Framework up-to-date with the latest version
  of that library. Ensure to copy the new systemic-framework-20150618.jar to your project's library and remove the previous
  version (systemic-framework-20140410.jar).

Removed Artifacts/Functionality
-------------------------------
- None

-- Upgrade Instructions --
--------------------------

Infrastructure Upgrade
----------------------
- Drop the latest framework library into your project's lib directory/directories. Note that the new  
  sif3.1Infra-model-<version>.jar is now also required in your projetc's lib directories. Ensure that you
  remove all jar files with the prefix 'sif3.0.1Infra' since they are replaced with the new jar files.
- Replace systemic-framework-20140410.jar with systemic-framework-20150618.jar in your projetc's lib directories.
- Remove the the following attribute from all environment templates:
      xmlns="http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.0.1"
  Environment templates are in the sub-directories of the config/environments directory. Removing of this
  attribute simplifies the use of different SIF Infrastructure versions.
- Add "delayed.<prop_name>" properties to the consumer.properties file(s). Please refer to StudentConsumer.properties
  in the directory config/consumers for example. Suggested values are:
      delayed.enabled=false
      delayed.queue.strategy=ADAPTER_LEVEL
      delayed.queue.name=
      delayed.queue.type=IMMEDIATE
      delayed.queue.subscribers=1
      delayed.polling.frequency=120
      delayed.longPolling.timeout=30
      delayed.subscriptions.removeOnShutdown=false

==========================================================================================================================
Providers ONLY: Potential Compilation Error!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use external security service functionality in your provider you will get a compilation error with the latest
SIF3 Framework libraries. To resolve that compilation error, you must implement the following method in your concrete
implementation of the security class that extends the AbstractSecurityService:

   TokenInfo generateToken(TokenCoreInfo coreInfo, String password)
   
This new method is enforced by the AbstractSecurityService class. The new method is only used by consumers and therefore
can be 'nulled' out in your security class:

   public TokenInfo generateToken(TokenCoreInfo coreInfo, String password) {
      return null;
   }
==========================================================================================================================

==========================================================================================================================
Consumers ONLY: Compilation Error due to DELAYED request/response functionality
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of the SIF3 Framework has added the functionality of DELAYED request/response. Since this is only visible to
consumers but not providers, the consumers must implement a few more methods. Each consumer class that extends the 
AbstractConsumer or AbstractEventConsumer class is forced to implement the following additional methods:

    public void processDelayedCreateMany(MultiOperationStatusList<CreateOperationStatus> statusList, 
                                         DelayedResponseReceipt receipt);
	
    public void processDelayedUpdateMany(MultiOperationStatusList<OperationStatus> statusList, 
                                         DelayedResponseReceipt receipt);
	
    public void processDelayedDeleteMany(MultiOperationStatusList<OperationStatus> statusList, 
                                         DelayedResponseReceipt receipt);
	
    public void processDelayedQuery(Object dataObject, 
                                    PagingInfo pagingInfo, 
                                    DelayedResponseReceipt receipt);
	
    public void processDelayedServicePath(Object dataObject, 
                                          QueryCriteria queryCriteria, 
                                          PagingInfo pagingInfo, 
                                          DelayedResponseReceipt receipt);
    
    public void processDelayedError(ErrorDetails error, 
                                    DelayedResponseReceipt receipt);

If your consumer or one of the consumer classes does not make use of DELAYED request/response then the above methods
can be "nulled out" in the consumer class:

    public void processDelayedCreateMany(MultiOperationStatusList<CreateOperationStatus> statusList, 
                                         DelayedResponseReceipt receipt)
    {
    	// nothing to do...
    }
    
For details of each of the above method, please refer to the javadoc of the DelayedConsumer or AbstractConsumer class in 
this framework or section 5.5.2.2.4 in the Developer's Guide.

Data Model Upgrade
------------------
All test case use SIF AU 3.4 now (sifDataModel_au3.4.jar replaced sifDataModel_au1.3.jar in the WEB-INF/lib directory).
