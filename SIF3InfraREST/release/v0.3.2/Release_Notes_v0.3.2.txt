Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed issue where ACL check was wrong for the provider in a brokered environment.
- Removed dependency of external servlet-api.jar in ant build script. 

What has Changed

- Provider had only one thread for a particular Object Provider class. Now each time a request is 
  received by the provider the standard web-/app container threading is used.

will be required in your service implementations. Simply drop the latest framework libraries into
