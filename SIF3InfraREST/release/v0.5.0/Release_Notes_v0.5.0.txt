==============================================================
Release Notes for v0.5.0 of SIF3 Framework (February 10, 2015)
==============================================================

Bug Fixes
---------
None

New Functionality
-----------------
- Support for Service Path functionality which is a query mechanism. The SIF 3.0.1 specification describes the 
  Service Path functionality in details. This functionality is only applicable for Object Services and only to 
  query data. 
  This version of the framework has added support for this SIF 3.x function. Section 5.7 in the Developer's Guide 
  illustrates how this new query mechanism is used within the SIF3 Framework for Consumers as well as for Object
  Providers.
- Support for External Security Services. SIF 3.0.1 specifies two authentication methods (Basic & SIF_HMACSHA256).
  There is a strong push to allow additional authentication mechanisms provided through external security services
  such as OAuth, SAML etc. to be utilised with SIF. This version allows to integrate external security services.
  Caution should be taken in using this functionality as it is not officially part of the SIF 3.0.1 specification 
  yet and therefore it is considered as experimental at this stage. Please refer to Section 5.8 of the Developer's
  Guide for details on external security services.   

Changed Functionality
---------------------
Allow more flexible media type management for Object Provider/Consumers. It is possible to deal with objects that are 
not XML or JSON. Due to this functionality the UnmarshalFactory and MarshalFactory interfaces have changed. If you have 
written your own marshaller/unmarshaller you will be forced to add three more methods to these implementations.
Refer to Data Model Upgrade Instructions further down in this document.

Removed Artifacts/Functionality

-- Upgrade Instructions --
--------------------------

Infrastructure Upgrade
----------------------
This release of the SIF3 Framework requires a structural change to the SIF3_SESSION table. The following SQL
script MUST BE RUN before the latest version of the SIF3 Framework libraries can be used:

  <framework_rootpath>/DB/DDL/Datafix/current/v0.4-v0.5/Datafix20141212_<db_type>.sql
  
The SQL script will not change the content of the SIF3_SESSION table. It will only add two new columns (nullable).

Once the SIF3_SESSION table has been upgraded with the applicable SQL script the latest libraries/jar files in 
the <framework_rootpath>/release directory can be dropped into your SIF Project (of course you need to remove the
older version of the same libraries from your SIF project first). 

Data Model Upgrade
------------------
If you are using any data models generated by the SIF3Generator project (https://github.com/nsip/SIF3DMGenerator-Java) 
then you MUST re-build the appropriate data model library from that project. It will ensure that latest marshallers/unmarshallers
from that project are used. Drop the latest data model jar file into your project's lib directory and/or WEB-INF/lib directory.

If you are using the SIF AU data model you can find the latest build within the SIF3 Framework in the <install_dir>/lib/datamodel.
Drop the jar file from that directory into your project's lib directory and/or WEB-INF/lib directory.

The new functionality available in this version of the framework should not affect any classes exposed to the developer except if
you have developed your own implementation of a MarshalFactory and/or UnmarshalFactory. In this case please refer to the 'Changed 
Functionality' section in this release notes file.
