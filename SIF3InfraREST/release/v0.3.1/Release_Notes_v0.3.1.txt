==========================================================
Release Notes for v0.3.1 of SIF3 Framework (11 Sept, 2014)
==========================================================

What is New
-----------
- Additional metadata about the consumer's request is passed along to the object provider.
- Additional metadata about the provider's event is passed along to the object consumer.

To enable the above functionality the Provider Interface (Provider.java) and Event Consumer Interface
(EventConsumer.java) needed some changes. This will break your current object providers and object
consumers (consumers only if you have extended the AbstarctEventConsumer).
