-- Infrastructure Upgrade --
----------------------------
Due to the support of the "Fingerprint" in SIF 3.2.1 there was the need to update the database structure of the 
SIF3_SESSION table. There is a SQL script THAT MUST BE RUN first to upgrade the database. It will add a new
column to the SIF3_SESSION table and it will also upgrade the namespace of all existing environment XML in that 
table to SIF 3.2.1.
The script can be found in the directory <frameworkInstall>/DB/DDL/Datafix/current/v0.10.0-v0.11.0. Run the script
with the name Datafix20170314_<dbType>.sql. If you use a database other than the ones that have an update script
provided you should be able to derive your script based on one of the provided one's.

The environment template XMLs need a fix as well. They should be in a directory called "environments/consumer/template"
and "environments/provider/template". Ensure that the namespace http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.1 or 
http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.0.1 is changed to http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.2.1.

Once the above steps are done you can upgrade your project with the latest libraries of the framework as stated below:

Ant:
Drop the latest framework library into your project's lib directory/directories

Maven:
Use the latest maven dependency
<dependency>
   <groupId>sif3.framework</groupId>
   <artifactId>sif3-infra-rest</artifactId>
   <version>0.11.0</version>
</dependency>

-- Data Model Upgrade --
------------------------
None.

------------------------------
-- 3rd Party Library Update --
------------------------------
The SIF3 Framework uses the sfl4j as its logging framework. This has changed from the hard-wired log4j. This change allows that the
implementation can easily choose between logging implementations. To allow proper and full logging a slf4j binding implementation
must be provided with your implementation. The example in the SIF3Demo project uses the slf4j-log4j12 as a binding implementation.
 - Maven: Simply add the appropriate bridge dependency to your project (see SIF3Demo for an example). 
 - Ant: You need to add the slf4j-api-<version>.jar and an appropriate slf4j bridging jar (i.e. self4j-log4j-<version>) to your 
        project.
