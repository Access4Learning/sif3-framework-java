==============================================================
Release Notes for v0.11.0 of SIF3 Framework (MMM DD, 2017)
==============================================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix pom.xml for sif3-common to ensure the latest jettison library is used rather than an old one
  that is included through jersey. Old one has a bug with JSON deserialising. Latest version fixes
  that issue.

New Functionality
-----------------
- Updated framework to use SIF 3.2.1 Infrastructure namespace and data model.
- Support for "Fingerprint" as per SIF 3.2.1 Infrastructure. Please refer to notes in "Infrastructure Upgrade" 
  section further down.

Changed Functionality
---------------------
- Dependency on slf4j rather than hard-wired log4j. Please refer to notes in "3rd Party Library Update" section 
  further down.
- Approach to link externals security services (i.e. OAuth) to the framework has changed slightly).
  THIS WILL BREAK YOUR CODE if you use this functionality. See Infrastructure Upgrade section below for more details.

----------------------------
-- Infrastructure Upgrade --
----------------------------
DB Upgrade Step 1
-----------------
Due to the support of the "Fingerprint" in SIF 3.2.1 there was the need to update the database structure of the 
SIF3_SESSION table. There is a SQL script THAT MUST BE RUN first to upgrade the database. It will add a new
column to the SIF3_SESSION table and it will also upgrade the namespace of all existing environment XML in that 
table to SIF 3.2.1.
The script can be found in the directory <frameworkInstall>/DB/DDL/Datafix/current/v0.10.0-v0.11.0. Run the script
with the name Datafix20170314_<dbType>.sql. If you use a database other than the ones that have an update script
provided you should be able to derive your script based on one of the provided one's.

DB Upgrade Step 2
-----------------
Some new tables have been added to allow more flexible configuration when external security services need to be
enabled (i.e. OAuth). For this run the database SQL script named Datafix20170330_<dbType>.sql in the 
<frameworkInstall>/DB/DDL/Datafix/current/v0.10.0-v0.11.0. If you use a database other than the ones that have an 
update script provided you should be able to derive your script based on one of the provided one's.

Environment Template Upgrade
---------------------------- 
The environment template XMLs need a fix as well. They should be in a directory called "environments/consumer/template"
and "environments/provider/template". Ensure that the namespace http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.1 or 
http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.0.1 is changed to http://www.sifassociation.org/infrastructure/3.2.1.

Upgrade your Project
--------------------
Once the above steps are done you can upgrade your project with the latest libraries of the framework as stated below:

Ant:
Drop the latest framework library into your project's lib directory/directories

Maven:
Use the latest maven dependency
<dependency>
   <groupId>sif3.framework</groupId>
   <artifactId>sif3-infra-rest</artifactId>
   <version>0.11.0</version>
</dependency>


==========================================================================================================================
External Security Services ONLY: Compilation Error due to new parameter in Constructor of AbstractSecurityService Class.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to an additional parameters in the constructor of the AbstractSecurityService class all classes that extend that class will
report a compilation error. Please note only the additional parameter must be added to rectify the compile error. You wont't 
need to change any other code.

Name & Type of Parameter: Map<String, String> securityServiceParameters

Add the above parameter to the constructor of your class that extends the AbstractSecurityService class. Your constructor
signature will change from:

  public YourSecurityClassName(AdvancedProperties properties)
  {
    ...
  }

to:

  public YourSecurityClassName(AdvancedProperties properties, 
                               Map<String, String> securityServiceParameters) // <== NOTE NEW PARAMETER
  {
    ...
  }

Due to the change how external Security Services are configured you will need to configure the SIF3_EXT_SECURITY_SERVICE
table as listed in the developer's guide in section 5.10. Basically the property value called adapter.security.service in
your adapter's property file will now be in the SIF3_EXT_SECURITY_SERVICE table in the column IMPLEMENTATION_CLASS.  

------------------------
-- Data Model Upgrade --
------------------------
None.

------------------------------
-- 3rd Party Library Update --
------------------------------
The SIF3 Framework uses the sfl4j as its logging framework. This has changed from the hard-wired log4j. This change allows that the
implementation can easily choose between logging implementations. To allow proper and full logging a slf4j binding implementation
must be provided with your implementation. The example in the SIF3Demo project uses the slf4j-log4j12 as a binding implementation.
 - Maven: Simply add the appropriate bridge dependency to your project (see SIF3Demo for an example). 
 - Ant: You need to add the slf4j-api-<version>.jar and an appropriate slf4j bridging jar (i.e. self4j-log4j-<version>) to your 
        project.
