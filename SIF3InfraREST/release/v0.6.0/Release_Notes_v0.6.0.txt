==============================================================
Release Notes for v0.6.0 of SIF3 Framework (Month Day, 2015)
==============================================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Return HTTP Status of 403 (Forbidden) if consumer issues a request for an operation where it doesn't have 
  permission for (i.e. ACL states a 'REJECT" for a particular operation). Now it meets the latest SIF Specification.
- Return HTTP Status of 400 (Bad Request) if a unsupported query criteria is provides in a service path call. Now it
  meets the latest SIF Specification.

New Functionality
-----------------
- Support for auditing on the provider. See Section 5.x in the Developer's Guide for details on how to enable
  auditing and what can be audited.
- Added DataTooLargeException to retrieve() method in Provider interface and retrieveByServicePath() method in the
  QueryProvider interface. This enabled the developer to raise an appropriate exception if the requested data set
  is too large. The exception will be translated into appropriate HTTP Status in the response to meet the SIF
  specification.

Changed Functionality
---------------------
- Servlet 3.0 Requirement:
  Due to some features in the SIF3 Framework the provider must be deployed in a web-/application container that 
  supports the servlet v3.0 specification. Please refer to your web-/application container's documentation to ensure 
  that it supports the servlet 3.0 specification. Tomcat 7 and above, Jetty 8 and above, JBoss AS 6 and above, Glassfish 3.x
  all support the servlet 3.0 specification.
- RequestMetadata parameter in all methods of the provider interface is populated correctly. Also the RequestMetadata object
  has new properties. Most notable it gives access to all URL Query parameters and all HTTP Header fields. Please refer to
  Javadoc for that object as it holds important information how each property is populated.

Removed Artifacts/Functionality

-- Upgrade Instructions --
--------------------------

Infrastructure Upgrade
----------------------
Depending on your implementation of your provider you may need to add the DataTooLargeException to the list of 
exceptions in the retrieve() and/or retrieveByServicePath() method to avoid a compile error. Otherwise all of 
the above fixes & changes do not affect any classes currently exposed to the developer. No code changes
will be required in your service implementations to upgrade from version v0.5.0 to this version. Simply drop the 
latest framework libraries into your project and all changes will be available without any other interactions 
by the developer.

Because of the requirement for the servlet 3.0 support for providers the web.xml for your deployment MUST have the appropriate
entry to indicate the servlet 3.0 specification. Generally the first line in the web.xml must be something like this:

<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee 
         http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd" 
         version="3.0">
         
Note the version number in the 'version' attribute as well as the version number of the xsd namespace.         


Data Model Upgrade
------------------
None.
